Odin-Recipes

The current project I am working on by following along with The Odin Project(TOP) is called "Recipes".

By This point in learning along with the projects, I have gained knowledge on:
    • Setting up Git
    • Creating my first repository
    • Writing out tests to a local folder that is connected to GitHub via SSH protocol
    • Setting up SSH and all other steps in connecting a Directory folder on my local computer to GitHub
    • And making adjustments through staging, pulling, & pushing projects to GitHub in CLI
    • HTML basics and how to write text, make visually interesting text(through the strong/b/i/em prompt), etc.
    • And finally, my current understanding on html has ended two lessons ago with incorporating my solid foundations into how to add titles, anchored links, creating sub-folders/sub-directories, and learning about image types and incorporating them with different "href"/"src" coding parametrics

The most recent project I completed with TOP was on "Writing GOOD Git Commits". Hopefully, through more work and growth, my commits will be easily deciphered and a good roadmap for anyone looking to follow in my train of thought when making projects in the future.

Within this current lesson/project (don't forget that it's called "Recipes"), the steps I have taken to get this far include:
    • Using CLI to create a directory on my local computer
    • Changing directories into the drive
    • Navigating to GitHub through my browser and creating this specific repository
    • Using Visual Studio's terminal to clone the repository(repo) to my local computer
    • And now, I am finalizing writing out this novel of a README.md file for your viewing and reading pleasure.

I hope this is helpful in discussing the purpose of this repo, and I am excited to keep progressing to bringing in more as time continues on.

Farewell fellow traveler and coding/programming enthusiast!
