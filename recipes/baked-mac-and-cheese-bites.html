    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray
        <li>8 ounces elbow macaroni
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk
        <li>2 cups shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese, divided
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
        <li>Salt (enough to add to the water to make it <em>slightly</em> salty to the taste)
        <li>1 large egg, beaten (primarily with a fork, makes less mess)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol><strongs>Step 1:</strongs>
    Preheat the ovn to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 2 mini muffin pans with cooking spray.
    <br>
    <strong>Step 2:</strong>
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite. Takes roughly 7-9 minutes; drain.
    <br>
    <strong>Step 3:</strong>
    Melt the butter in a large sauce/soup pot over medium heat. Grab a whisk, and whisk in flour until smooth. Add the milk and bring to a low simmer. Now, add the Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir until smooth (i.e. think queso).
    <strong><em>Pro Tip:</em></strong> Add the flour slowly to not get clumps.
    <br>
    <strong>Step 4:</strong>
    Add drained pasta and the beaten egg to the cheese sauce and stir well until evenly combined.
    <br>
    <strong>Step 5:</strong>
    Using a clean and small spoon, divide the mixture between the mini muffin tins (if you have some still left over after doing so, keep as a snack).
    <br>
    <strong>Step 6:</strong>
    Finally, place the mini muffin tins into your preheated oven and cook until golden brown, or roughly 14-16 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving.
