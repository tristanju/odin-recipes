    <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <strong>Step 1:</strong>
            Gather all of your Ingredients
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong>
            Cook Sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise, overlapping slightly, over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 9:</strong>
            Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong>
            Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving and enjoy!
